 `android:label="My App"`
2. Change the value of CFBundleName from /iOS/Runner/info.plist

Please do NOT put slash ( / ) at the end of your base url. Use your admin url as base url. First you have to install your admin panel. For example: If your admin url is https://admin.your_domain.com base url will be https://your_domain.com. Open `/lib/app_constants.dart` and replace baseUrl variable value with your own URL.

`static const String baseUrl='https://your_domain.com'`

Firstly, find out the existing package name. You can find it out from top of `/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file.

In first box you have to put existing package name that you saw in `AndroidManifest.xml` file previously and then write down your preferred package name in second box and then click on Replace All button.
